Copy this folder to where you want the program to run and 
write the literate program. Running the weave-tangle script
weaves, and tangles and cleans up after itself. 

The scratchpad.html file is a tiddly contains todo notes and other random scratchpad
notes done in the process of developing the program. Basically used as a scaffolding
system for the code. Better than Org mode because it allows me to tag and organize 
various little bunches of thoughts. 

If you only want to tangle then just pass the option --tangle-only

Change the name litprog to whatever you want in the weave-tangle-clean 
script and clean scripts

Each literate program is contained in one folder. Thus each suite of related 
program is meant to be written as an academic paper with references 
and all that. 

The main file and all are present in the form of Appendices. Only algorithmic code
goes at the top. 


To compile the TeX files, in addition to a TeX distribution you will 
need Asymptote (http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) for rendering 2D 
vector graphics and 3D raster graphics.
