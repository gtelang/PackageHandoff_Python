    
To run this code, you will need a distribution of Python 2.7.12 along 
with the following libraries

- networkx
- matplotlib
- numpy 
- scipy
- cgal-bindings
- cvxpy

All source code is contained in the .web file. If you modify the file, the 
resulting code and corresponding description file can be weaved and tangled 
with the script `weave-tangle.sh`. You will need the 

- [pdflatex](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdflatex)
- [nuweb](http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/) 
- [asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) 
  
executables to be somewhere on your system's path. 

All source code is in the `src' directory. The asy2d,asy3d and docs
folders can be neglected since they contain images and documents 
referenced in the `packagehandoff.pdf' file. From the point of view of 
_running_ the code they can be ignored.
